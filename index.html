<div id="aboutContent" class="content">
<p>DiSCOVER is a youth development program under the Mon Sheong Youth Group, geared at helping Chinese Canadian youths learn more about their cultural roots. The program commenced in 2009 and continued in 2010, 2011 and most recently in 2013. DiSCOVER was formerly known as "Trip to China" but was re-branded in 2013 in order to better reflect its mission of facilitating self and cultural discovery among its participants.</p>

<p>A two month program from May - June 2015, DiSCOVER encompasses a series of cultural workshops, Mandarin classes, speaker sessions, volunteer opportunities, a leadership retreat - all of which culminates in a 2 week subsidized trip to China in July 2015. The goal of the program is to offer its participants a rewarding and multifaceted cultural development.</p>

<p>What sets DiSCOVER apart from other travel abroad programs is the myriad of unique opportunities DiSCOVER has to offer beyond just sightseeing. While in China, participants will get a chance to dine and converse with local government officials, connect with local university students, volunteer at a local senior home - hands-on opportunities that would guarantee DiSCOVER youth participants a highly genuine and memorable experience.</p>

<p>DiSCOVER truly is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to learn, experience and grow!</p>
</div>

<div id="philosophyContent" class="content hidden">
<p>Established in 1964, the Mon Sheong Foundation is a registered Canadian charitable organization, dedicated to the promotion of Chinese culture, heritage, language, and philosophy through caring for the elderly, encouraging the young and providing programs and services in response to the needs of our community.</p>

<p>The two month DiSCOVER program will allow our youth participants to learn, through first-hand participation, the significance of volunteerism. Our endeavour is for our participants to develop new skills, hone existing talents as well as discover the enduring values of dedication, commitment and determination.</p>

<p>Our biggest wish is for our youth participants to walk away from this program with a better understanding of the importance of sharing and kindness, acting as ambassadors for the Mon Sheong Foundation's philosophy and be lifelong philanthropists and volunteers in their communities.</p>
</div>

<div id="teamContent" class="content hidden">
<p>The DiSCOVER team is a group of dedicated youths who have come together with a common vision in mind: to deliver a unique cultural development program in order to promote Chinese culture to youths within the Greater Toronto community.</p>

<p>Our team consists of over 20 talented and accomplished individuals, each with their own strengths, expertise and experience. The DiSCOVER program is entirely a youth-led volunteer initiative with volunteers leading everything from marketing to sponsorship to participant relations to programming.  Asides from organizing the DiSCOVER program, our team also regularly volunteers at Mon Sheong Youth Group events in order to further give back to the community.</p>

<p>The DiSCOVER program could not materialize without the hard work of these dedicated and committed youth leaders!</p>

<p class="overview_intro">DiSCOVER offers a unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for select enrolled youth to visit China at the end of the two months. Popularly known as Trip to China, it now serves as the culminating activity.<br><br>

The youth are able to see and experience China first-hand while having the unique opportunity to put their learning to the ultimate test abroad. During the trip, we also encourage the youth to compare and contrast the ways of living in China to that of Canada such that they are able to better appreciate their heritage and culture.  Participants will be supervised throughout by five youth leaders and at least two Mon Sheong staff members.</p>

<div id="tripContent" class="content hidden">
<p id="trip-style">The trip offers a unique and multifaceted experience of China. Participants will be afforded a chance to explore the wonderful riches of Chinese culture at its capital, Beijing, and Shandong - the home province of great Chinese historical figures such as Lord Mengchang and Confucius. The trip will also bring our youth participants to Xi’An, home of the terracotta warriors and culminate in Hong Kong, a special administrative region (SAR) of China and a former British colony. The goal of this trip is to allow our participants to see and experience China from multiple perspectives. In addition, while in China, our participants will be given opportunities to interact and converse with local government officials, university students, seniors, businesses and so forth in order to facilitate a truly hands-on minds-on experience. We want our participants to not only see China, but to experience and engage in meaningful dialogue with its people. Participants will be supervised throughout by five youth leaders and at least two Mon Sheong staff members.</p>
</div>

<div id="lessonsContent" class="content hidden">
<p id="lessons-style">This 2-month course is unique in the sense that it is geared towards bringing our participants to a conversational proficiency in Mandarin. The course will utilize a wide variety of effective teaching strategies in order to accommodate the range of learners and abilities, with a focus on real-life connections and practical vocabulary. The goal is to prepare our participants for the trip and allow them to use the skills they developed during the program in China.</p>
</div>

<div id="retreatContent" class="content hidden">
<p id="retreat-style">This retreat will entail a weekend of interactive team-building activities for our program participants. This is an excellent opportunity for our participants to get to know each other and forge new friendships prior to the trip.</p>
</div>

<div id="workshopsContent" class="content hidden">
<p id="workshops-style"><b>In-House Workshops</b><br>
A range of cultural interest workshops will be provided in order to offer our participants a multi-faceted developmental opportunity to learn more about Chinese culture holistically. Cultural development should not be compartmentalized but should be experienced as a whole to reap its full benefits. Workshops will include (may be subject to change): Chinese calligraphy, dragon boat, Chinese opera, tea tasting, and martial arts.<br><br>

<b>In-China Workshops</b><br>
Participants will be afforded unique opportunities in China, such as dining with and engaging in conversation with local government officials, participating in lectures at renowned Chinese universities as well as volunteering at a local senior home. These one-of-a-kind experiences set our trip apart from other travel opportunities; it offers our participants a meaningful and memorable chance to experience China from a very personal and local perspective.</p>
</div>

<div id="speakersContent" class="content hidden">
<p id="speakers-style">Four high profile speakers from a range of disciplines in our community will be invited to speak to our youth participants in order to inspire, encourage and provide guidance. We understand that many of our participants may be in school or starting their careers and it would be beneficial to hear the experiences and tips from accomplished mentors from their own community.</p>
</div>

<div id="volunteerContent" class="content hidden">
<p id="volunteering-style">One of the most unique aspects of the DiSCOVER program is the abundance of philanthropic opportunities available to our participants. During the duration of the 2 month program, participants will be able to partake in many in-house volunteer events at our various Mon Sheong locations. Past volunteer events, such as tree-planting, have been very well received and proved to be a fun and rewarding volunteer experience as well as providing our participants another platform to bond and get to know one another prior to the trip.</p>
</div>

<div id="conferenceContent" class="content hidden">
<p id="conference-style">The goal of these press conferences is to allow the Greater Toronto community to learn more about the DiSCOVER program and the wonderful experiences of our participants.</p>

<!-- General Inquiries -->
<div class="answers hidden">
<p class="q_style">How much does it cost to enroll into DiSCOVER 2015?</p>
<p>The cost of DiSCOVER 2015 is $2,500. This includes all workshops, seminars, textbooks, and other learning equipment for the program. In addition, round-trip airfare to China from Toronto, all in-land transportation, accommodations, and meals while in China.</p>

<p class="q_style">What is the cancellation/refund policy for DiSCOVER?</p>
<p>There is a strict no refund policy for the DiSCOVER program. Once an applicant has been accepted to either the DiSCOVER program, he or she will have 5 days to accept or decline, and to make the full payment. Once accepted, there is a no refund policy. The reason for this policy is because many of the expenses incurred by the program are non-refundable. These costs include a sizeable deposit to the travel agency for flight and accommodation arrangements, a deposit for the DiSCOVER leadership retreat location, and the purchase of program materials.</p>

<p class="q_style">How can I join DiSCOVER as a volunteer/executive?</p>

<!-- Youth Development Program -->
<div class="answers hidden">
<p class="q_style">I'm interested in the DiSCOVER program, but will be away at school during the school year. Will I still be able to participate?</p>
<p>Most of the DiSCOVER programming will be scheduled for the weekends. If accepted, you will be expected to make significant efforts to attend all programming. We will have complimentary materials online for all participants who cannot make programming events, but attendance is strongly recommended.</p>

<p class="q_style">If I am selected for the DiSCOVER program, will I be automatically guaranteed a spot on the Trip to China?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="q_style">What if I'm already fluent in Mandarin? Is the Mandarin course still mandatory?</p>
<p>Yes. It would give you a chance to meet and interact with the other trip participants; perhaps you can take on a mentor role in the class and help out your classmates!</p>

<p class="q_style">Where will the classes and workshops be held?</p>
<p>Most of the classes and events will be held the Mon Sheong Scarborough Long Term Care Centre located at 2030 McNicoll Avenue, Scarborough, Ontario M1V 5P4.</p>
</div>

<!-- Trip to China -->
<div class="answers hidden">
<p class="q_style">My child is interested in attending Trip to China. How can I stay informed about their activities while they are away?</p>
<p>Participants of DiSCOVER will maintain a blog on their experiences. Parents can follow this blog for updates from the group.</p>

<p>Yes. While there are many activities planned for trip participants, there will also be free time for exploring, shopping, sightseeing, relaxation, etc. During free time, it is recommended that participants travel in groups.</p>

<p class="q_style">Will I be allowed to stay out late at night during our stay in China?</p>
<p>No. Participants will have free time after the planned activities, however, a 12am curfew will be in place for safety reasons.</p>

<p class="q_style">Will I be able to extend my stay in China, make my own travel arrangements to a different country, or change my airline tickets from round-trip to one-way?</p>
<p>No. For safety reasons, and because travel arrangements will be made for the group as a whole, you will not be allowed to extend your stay, travel independently, or change your airline tickets from round-trip to one-way.</p>
